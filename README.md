# hibari

Hibari is a capability-aware datastore compatibility layer.

Applications and existing software use ordinary data-access APIs while backend-specific App IDs, field codes, pagination rules, and concurrency tokens stay behind adapters. Unsupported or dangerous semantics are rejected before they become backend failures.

## Architecture

```text
consumer --------> @hibari/core <-------- backend
   |                    ^                   |
   |                    |                   |
@hibari/prisma          |           @hibari/kintone
```

Consumers and backends depend on the backend-neutral core. Consumer packages do not depend on concrete backend packages.

## Current implementation

### `@hibari/core`

- backend-neutral Schema / Query / Mutation IR
- backend-neutral `DatastoreRuntime`
- Capability Manifest
- `native` / `emulated` / `expensive` / `unsupported` planning
- inspectable Execution Plan
- stable structured diagnostics

### `@hibari/kintone`

- form-field introspection into Schema IR
- application field names mapped to kintone field codes
- kintone `$id` / `$revision` can stay hidden behind application aliases
- scalar filter / projection / ordering compiler
- cursor and offset pagination without silent 500-record truncation
- early rejection around the 10,000 offset ceiling
- create / batched createMany / update / updateMany / delete / semantic upsert
- optimistic concurrency through kintone revision
- injectable transport and fetch-based REST transport
- kintone limits centralized in one Capability Manifest

### `@hibari/prisma`

- Prisma ORM 7.9.1 driver adapter
- ordinary generated `PrismaClient` CRUD
- deterministic SQLite-shaped SQL subset -> Hibari IR
- SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / RETURNING
- stable early errors for unsupported JOIN / aggregate / transaction / schema SQL
- no dependency on `@hibari/kintone`

The integration suite proves this path end to end without live credentials:

```text
generated PrismaClient
  -> @hibari/prisma
  -> @hibari/core
  -> KintoneBackend
  -> fake kintone REST
```

Application CRUD in that proof contains no kintone App ID, field code, `$id`, `$revision`, REST endpoint, or pagination logic.

WordPress is the next consumer proof.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm test
```

`npm test` runs core contracts, kintone backend contracts, Prisma SQL/PrismaClient proofs, and the cross-package Prisma-to-kintone integration proof. Live kintone credentials are not required.
